You will be given an array of integers and a target value. Determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value.

For example, given an array of [1, 2, 3, 4] and a target value of 1, we have three values meeting the condition: 2-1 = 1, 3-2 = 1, and 4-3 = 1.

Function Description

Write a function pairs. It must return an integer representing the number of element pairs having the required difference.

Pairs has the following parameter(s):

k: an integer, the target difference
arr: an array of integers
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the size of arr and the target value.
The second line contains n space-separated integers of the array arr.
Sample Input
