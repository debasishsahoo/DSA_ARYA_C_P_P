Given two non-negative integers n1 and n2, where n1

For example:

Suppose n1=11 and n2=15.

There is the number 11, which has repeated digits, but 12, 13, 14 and 15 have no repeated digits. So, the output is 4.

Example1:

Input:

11 — Vlaue of n1
15 — value of n2
Output:

4
Example 2:

Input:

101 — value of n1
200 — value of n2
Output:

72
